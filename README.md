## gameswitch-express

This is an Express application created for a school assignment. It uses MongoDB with Mongoose and the EJS template engine.
Not all functionality is implemented. This was more for learning purposes than anything else.

To run:
- Clone the repository
- CD into the directory and `npm install`
- Open up the terminal and start a local server with `mongod`
- In the project directory, `npm start`
