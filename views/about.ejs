                        My name is Daniel Garwood, author and creator of GAMESWITCH. This is a project created for my
                        Netork Based Application Development course at UNC Charlotte.
                        I've loved video games since I was little, and I always wanted to be more involved in the gaming community.<br><br>
                        Here at GAMESWITCH, we make it easy to do just that. You can browse games other users have posted and
                        easilty contact them to discuss anything game related, possibly even trading games.<br><br>
                        I intend to improve the site's functionality overtime, allowing for a constantly improving user experience.
